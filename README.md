## Problem statement or motivation
As a football enthusiast, ...

***To what extent can football performance metrics such as expected goals (xG), shots, and possession be used to predict match outcome probabilities, and how do these model-implied probabilities differ from bookmaker odds?***

## Planned approach and technologies
1. Data collection:
   I will use different sources such as:
   - [Understat](https://understat.com/) for the collection of the fooball metrics such as the xG, shots on target etc.
   - [Fbref](https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats) also for the football metrics.
   - [Football-data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/) for the bookmakers odds.
     
2. Data cleaning/preparation:
3. 

## Expected challenges and how you’ll address them

## Success criteria (how will you know it’s working?)

## Stretch goals (if time permits)
